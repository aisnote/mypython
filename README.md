    10+ years ago, I wrote one aisnote app on windows to quickly save some ideas, notes using shortkey. And I just save the data to txt file. Each day have on file. That's a stupid thing, I think.But that works well at that time. But I keep this noting every day. Now these files will be like below:

    - 2010-11-25.txt
    - 2010-11-29.txt
    - 2010-12-02.txt
